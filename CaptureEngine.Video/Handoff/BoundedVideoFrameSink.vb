    ''' <summary>
    ''' Concrete bounded handoff sink owned by VideoLayer. (P1-A v1.3.1 §6.3, §6.7, §15.4)
    '''
    ''' This sink owns:
    '''   - the bounded queue (capacity default 2, max 16);
    '''   - the BoundedHandoffPolicy (DropOldest / DropNewest);
    '''   - all eviction / disposal of evicted frames.
    '''
    ''' The backend has ZERO knowledge of the policy or capacity; it only
    ''' observes PushOutcome from TryPush and reacts accordingly.
    '''
    ''' The sink is a simple FIFO queue protected by a lock. Consumers call
    ''' Take() to dequeue. P1-B.1 tests inject custom sinks (Recording,
    ''' Refusing, Evicting, Blocking) to exercise specific code paths; the
    ''' production BoundedVideoFrameSink is also exercised directly in
    ''' backpressure tests.

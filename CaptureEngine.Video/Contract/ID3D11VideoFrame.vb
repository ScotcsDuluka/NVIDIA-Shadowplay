' ID3D11VideoFrame.vb
'
' Extension of IVideoFrame that exposes the underlying D3D11 texture pointer
' for zero-copy GPU encoding.
'
' LOCATION RATIONALE (Phase 12 dependency audit):
'   This interface lives in CaptureEngine.Video (contract layer), NOT in
'   CaptureEngine.Encoder.Nvenc (concrete encoder project).
'
'   Why: D3D11-producing backends (CaptureEngine.Video.Ddagrab) must
'   implement this interface on their frame classes. If the interface
'   lived in CaptureEngine.Encoder.Nvenc, then Ddagrab would need a
'   ProjectReference to Encoder.Nvenc — creating a backward dependency
'   (Video backend → Encoder implementation) that violates the
'   replaceability principle. Encoder implementations should be swappable
'   without affecting capture backends.
'
'   By placing the interface in CaptureEngine.Video:
'     - Ddagrab can implement ID3D11VideoFrame (depends on Video contract only)
'     - NvencEncoderBackend can consume ID3D11VideoFrame (depends on Video
'       contract only — same dependency it already has for IVideoFrame)
'     - No backward dependency from Video → Encoder
'     - No circular reference
'
' FOUNDATION COMPLIANCE:
'   This is an ADDITIVE interface — it does NOT modify IVideoFrame or any
'   existing Foundation contract. CaptureEngine.Video is the contract layer
'   (not Foundation — Foundation is CaptureEngine/Engine/CaptureEngine.vb).
'   Adding new contract files to CaptureEngine.Video is permitted.
'
' BACKGROUND:
'   Foundation IVideoFrame does NOT expose native resource handles —
'   it carries Origin, PixelFormat, Dimensions, and Diagnostics only.
'   This is intentional: the contract supports CPU-memory frames as
'   well as GPU textures.
'
'   NvencEncoderBackend needs the D3D11 texture pointer to call
'   CopyResource (frame texture → encoder texture). Without an extension
'   interface, the encoder would need reflection or a TryCast hack —
'   both rejected per OWNER requirement.
'
' CONTRACT:
'   - Inherits CaptureEngine.Video.IVideoFrame (so existing contract is unchanged)
'   - Adds NativeTexture As IntPtr (the ID3D11Texture2D native pointer)
'   - Frame is still BORROWED — encoder MUST NOT dispose the texture
'     (the frame owner — typically DdagrabBackend — disposes it)
'
' HARD RULES COMPLIANCE:
'   ✅ Foundation contract unchanged (CaptureEngine.Video.IVideoFrame is in
'      CaptureEngine.Video, not Foundation CaptureEngine — additive OK)
'   ✅ No reflection in production path
'   ✅ No TryCast hack (DirectCast is type-safe at compile time)
'   ✅ Frame ownership = BORROW (encoder MUST NOT dispose texture)
'   ✅ No backward dependency from Video.Ddagrab → Encoder.Nvenc
'   ✅ No circular project reference

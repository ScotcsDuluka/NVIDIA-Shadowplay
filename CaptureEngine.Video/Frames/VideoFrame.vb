    ''' <summary>
    ''' Concrete VideoFrame implementation with ownership model.
    '''
    ''' Lifecycle: Created → Active → Disposed
    '''
    ''' Features:
    '''   - Implements IVideoFrame (generic contract, no D3D11/DXGI/NVENC ties)
    '''   - Dispose is thread-safe (Interlocked.Exchange guard)
    '''   - Dispose is idempotent (calling twice does not crash)
    '''   - Properties remain readable after Dispose (return cached values)
    '''   - Supports a resource cleanup callback (invoked once on first Dispose)
    '''   - IsDisposed property for checking state without try/catch
    '''
    ''' Thread safety:
    '''   - Dispose: thread-safe via Interlocked.CompareExchange
    '''   - Property reads: safe before and after Dispose (no lock needed;
    '''     values are immutable after construction)
    '''   - No locks on heavy operations — Dispose callback is called outside
    '''     any lock (it may do GPU release, native free, etc.)

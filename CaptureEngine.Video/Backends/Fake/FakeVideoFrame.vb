    ''' <summary>
    ''' Minimal IVideoFrame implementation for the fake backend. (P1-A v1.3.1 §3)
    '''
    ''' Tracks Dispose() calls so ownership/lifetime tests can assert that
    ''' every FrameAvailable result's frame is disposed exactly once by
    ''' whoever currently owns it (the sink under DropOldest, the backend
    ''' under DropNewest-with-Dropped outcome, or the consumer downstream).
    '''
    ''' RC-1 fix: Dispose is now thread-safe and idempotent.
    '''   - Uses Interlocked.CompareExchange guard (same pattern as Frames.VideoFrame)
    '''   - _disposeCount increments ONLY on first Dispose (guaranteed 0 or 1)
    '''   - Concurrent Dispose calls are safe — only first caller proceeds

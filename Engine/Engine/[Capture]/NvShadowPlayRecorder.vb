' NvShadowPlayRecorder.vb — "NVIDIA Engine" capture backend.
'
' Drives the INSTALLED NVIDIA ShadowPlay recorder (nvspcap64.exe, brought up
' by the GeForce Experience services) as an EXTERNAL recorder:
'
'   Start  → inject the ShadowPlay manual-record hotkey (Alt+F9) — the same
'            keys the user configured in GFE — NVIDIA starts recording with
'            its full driver-level pipeline (Replay, quality, in-game).
'   Stop   → inject Alt+F9 again — NVIDIA finalizes its own MP4.
'   Result → watch the NVIDIA videos folder for the newly created file and
'            hand its path back (the host then broadcasts
'            engine_recording_saved with the verified contract).
'
' Why external-recorder and not an IVideoCaptureBackend: the ShadowPlay
' recorder produces its OWN finished file — it never emits GPU frames, so it
' cannot satisfy the frame-pushing IVideoCaptureBackend contract. It lives
' one layer up, as a session regime selected via
' OverlayConfig.GetEngineMode() = "nvidia".
'
' Constraints (honest):
'   - NVIDIA records what ITS rules allow (supported games / desktop capture
'     enabled in GFE) — identical to real GFE behavior.
'   - Hotkey injection uses GFE's DEFAULT Alt+F9 binding; custom GFE hotkey
'     bindings are a TODO (configurable later via config.json).
'   - Start is optimistic: the file confirms the stop. Status truth is the
'     file, not the injection.

' Engine-Audio — Stress Test Runner
'
' Validates the two-process architecture (ffmpeg #1 video, AudioFileWriter sidecar,
' ffmpeg #2 mux) against the invariants defined in ENGINE-REALTIME-ARCHITECTURE.md:
'
'   ── INVIOLATE ──
'   ffmpeg #1:        NO audio input, NO mux, NO amix, NO resample
'   Audio callback:   copy + enqueue only (no disk I/O, no heavy allocation)
'   JobObjectGuard:   AboveNormal priority only (NO High/Realtime)
'   Accounting:       BytesEnqueued = WrittenBytes + DroppedBytes + DroppedSilenceBytes
'                     → BytesAccountingResidual MUST be 0 after clean drain
'
'   ── RED FLAGS (auto-fail: invariant violations) ──
'   DroppedBytes > 0              → real audio data loss
'   BytesAccountingResidual ≠ 0  → writer didn't drain OR counting bug
'   Writer FAILED                → disk write exception didn't propagate
'   ExpectAudioData but 0 bytes  → audio capture never started
'
'   ── HARD PERFORMANCE FAILURES (auto-fail: threshold exceeded) ──
'   FPS < (target × 0.95)         → video capture degraded
'   Speed < 0.95x                → FFmpeg can't keep up real-time
'   dup > 5% of expected frames   → ddagrab starved (video source issue)
'   drop > 5                     → FFmpeg dropping frames
'   WriteLagBytes > 0            → writer thread behind at stop time
'   AVSyncMs > 100ms             → final MP4 audio/video duration mismatch
'                                  (measured via ffprobe on final output, NOT WAV size)

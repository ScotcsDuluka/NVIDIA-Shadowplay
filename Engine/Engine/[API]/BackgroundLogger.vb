' BackgroundLogger.vb
' Single shared background file logger — replaces per-line File.AppendAllText.
'
' Problem (P1):
'   CaptureEngine.WriteDebugLog / UI_Engine.DebugLog / EncoderDetector.DebugLog
'   all call File.AppendAllText on every line. FFmpeg progress goes to stderr
'   at up to 60 lines/sec (one per frame). Each AppendAllText opens / writes /
'   closes the file → real disk thrash on long recordings + slow disk.
'
' Fix:
'   One BlockingCollection(Of String) per log file. A single background Task
'   per file drains the queue and writes in batches. Writers never block on
'   disk I/O. On process exit, the queue is drained synchronously so no log
'   lines are lost.
'
' Thread-safe. Multiple callers writing to the same file share one queue.

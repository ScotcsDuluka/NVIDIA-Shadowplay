' JobObjectGuard.vb
' Tie FFmpeg child process to a Win32 Job Object with KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE.
'
' Problem (P1):
'   If the Engine process is killed (Task Manager, crash, logoff), the
'   ffmpeg.exe child keeps running as an orphan — still consuming GPU/CPU,
'   still holding the output file open, still writing frames to nowhere.
'
' Fix:
'   Create one Job Object per CaptureEngine instance, with
'   JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE. Assign every spawned ffmpeg to it.
'   When the Engine process dies for any reason, Windows automatically
'   kills all processes in the Job → ffmpeg dies with it.
'
'   The job handle is held alive by _jobHandle (a SafeHandle) for the
'   lifetime of the CaptureEngine instance. When CaptureEngine.Dispose
'   runs (or the Engine process exits and the SafeHandle finalizes),
'   the handle closes and Windows cleans up the children.
'
'   Note: We do NOT set JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_BREAKAWAY_OK, so ffmpeg cannot
'   escape the job even if it tried.

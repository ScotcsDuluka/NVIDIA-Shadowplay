' RecordingEngineHost.vb
'
' Partial class of UI_Engine that adds Phase 12b RecordingEngine integration.
' Replaces the legacy CaptureEngine (FFmpeg subprocess) with the new
' RecordingEngine (D3D11 + NVENC + NAudio sidecar + FFmpeg mux).
'
' Architecture:
'   RecordingEngine (process-lifetime, persistent GPU resources)
'       ↓ StartSession(config) — BLOCKS until duration or Stop()
'       ↓ Run on background thread (Task.Run) → UI thread not blocked
'   CaptureSession (per-session: audio sidecar + H.264 + wrap + mux → MP4)
'
' Phase 12b hardening (this file):
'   ✔ Initialize runs OFF the UI thread (D3D11 + DXGI + NVENC init can take
'     hundreds of ms — must never block form load / message pump)
'   ✔ FFmpeg resolution order per Phase-11 postmortem lesson #1:
'     settings path → deployment root (exe dir + API-Core) → exe dir → PATH
'   ✔ Full Config → SessionConfig/EngineStartupConfig mapping from
'     CaptureSettings (codec, bitrate, GOP=fps, audio enable, volume)
'   ✔ JobObjectGuard (KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE) owns every spawned ffmpeg/ffprobe
'     via the OnProcessStarted hook → no orphan FFmpeg, even on host crash
'
' Integration:
'   HandleEngineRecordStart → start background task → respond "ok" immediately
'   HandleEngineRecordStop  → _recordingEngine.Stop() → await task → respond
'   HandleEngineGetStatus   → _recordingEngine.GetStatus() → respond

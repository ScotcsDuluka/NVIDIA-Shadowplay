''' <summary>
''' File-based audio recorder — writes WASAPI capture to .wav files via
''' a lock-free queue + dedicated writer thread.
'''
''' ARCHITECTURE (Two-Process Recording):
'''   Video: FFmpeg ddagrab → NVENC → temp_video.mp4 (NO audio input)
'''   Audio: This class → temp_system.wav + temp_mic.wav (direct file I/O)
'''   Mux:   FFmpeg -i video.mp4 -i audio.wav -c:v copy -c:a aac final.mp4
'''
''' DESIGN PRINCIPLES (per GPT code review):
'''   1. NO wall-clock silence feeder thread — gap detection happens IN the
'''      callback, inserting silence BEFORE real audio (no overlap possible)
'''   2. NO synchronous disk I/O in callback — callback just memcpy + enqueue
'''   3. NO volume processing in callback — volume applied at mux stage
'''   4. NO fake latency measurement — per-track actual start timestamps
'''   5. Proper shutdown: stop capture → drain → flush writer → finalize

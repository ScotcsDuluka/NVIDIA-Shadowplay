Namespace CaptureEngine.FFmpegBackend
    ''' <summary>
    ''' Manages a single FFmpeg process lifecycle: spawn, stdin 'q' quit,
    ''' stderr redirection, WaitForExit, Kill.
    '''
    ''' P1-C Commit 2: Full implementation.
    '''
    ''' Thread safety:
    '''   - This class is NOT internally synchronized.
    '''   - Caller (FFmpegPipelineBackend) must serialize Start/SendQuit/WaitForExit/Kill
    '''     via its own SyncLock.
    '''   - The Exited event fires on a threadpool thread (Process.Exited callback).
    '''   - The StderrLine event fires on a threadpool thread (ErrorDataReceived callback).
    '''
    ''' Critical rule (per OWNER):
    '''   ❌ NEVER hold a lock across WaitForExit() / Kill()
    '''   ✅ These methods are designed to be called OUTSIDE the caller's lock
    '''
    ''' Error handling:
    '''   - Start() throws FileNotFoundException if FFmpegPath doesn't exist
    '''   - Start() throws InvalidOperationException if already running
    '''   - SendQuit() swallows exceptions (pipe may already be closed)
    '''   - Kill() swallows exceptions (process may already be dead)
    '''   - WaitForExit() returns False on timeout (does NOT throw)

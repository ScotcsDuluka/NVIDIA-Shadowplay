' AudioTap.vb — ONE gap-fill engine for BOTH capture tracks (system + mic).
'
' Consolidates the duplicated gap-fill v2 logic (previously copy-pasted in
' CaptureSession for system audio and mic) per the GLM/6 audit recommendation.
' Single implementation = single place to fix sync math, single evidence model.
'
' WALL-CLOCK MODEL (v2, owner-validated):
'   WASAPI delivers callbacks only when audio data exists. Between callbacks
'   the elapsed REAL time passes but no bytes arrive. This tap reconstructs
'   the true timeline: when a buffer arrives, its content already SPANS the
'   gap (WASAPI accumulated it), so:
'       silenceNeeded = arrivalGap − bufferDuration
'   Every silence byte goes to BOTH the WAV sidecar AND the live-mux pipe —
'   one timeline everywhere. Pre-roll: the first callback arrives LATE by the
'   device's warm-up (this machine: loopback first callback ≈ 5.7s — legacy
'   logged SysFirstCallbackDelayMs=5756.7); the silent head before it is real
'   wall-clock silence and must be inserted or the music shifts to t=0.
'
' DEVICE LATENCY (audit round 2): the byte stream's notion of 'now' is the
' ARRIVAL time, but the audio in a buffer was CAPTURED earlier by the device
' latency L (WASAPI shared mode ≈ 10-40ms). Compensating = shift the whole
' stream earlier by L (leadSec). The lead is applied by advancing the tap's
' origin: silenceNeeded is computed from (arrival − L) instead of arrival,
' which lands every buffer L earlier on the timeline.

    ''' Audio sidecar: records WASAPI audio to temp .wav files independently
    ''' of the FFmpeg video process.
    '''
    ''' P1-C Commit 4: OPTIONAL STUB — no WASAPI implementation.
    '''
    ''' This is a lifecycle-safe placeholder. Start() and Stop() are no-ops
    ''' that set internal state correctly. HasAudioData always returns False.
    ''' When WASAPI is added (future task), replace the stub bodies with
    ''' real NAudio.WasapiCapture initialization.
    '''
    ''' Architecture (per Engine-Audio two-process design):
    '''   - Start() is called AFTER FFmpegProcessHost.Start() (video starts first)
    '''   - Stop() is called AFTER FFmpegProcessHost exits (audio records through
    '''     FFmpeg shutdown time; extra audio is trimmed by mux -t <videoDuration>)
    '''   - Two temp .wav files: temp.system.wav + temp.mic.wav
    '''   - Per-track start timestamps captured for mux offset calculation
    '''
    ''' Thread safety:
    '''   - Start/Stop are called from the FFmpegPipelineBackend thread (serialized)
    '''   - Internal state protected by SyncLock

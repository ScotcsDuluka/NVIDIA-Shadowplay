Namespace CaptureEngine.Backends
    ''' <summary>
    ''' Contract for video capture backends. Replaces direct FFmpeg invocation
    ''' so the Engine can support both FFmpeg-based backends (ddagrab/gdigrab/
    ''' gfxcapture) and future native backends (DXGI Desktop Duplication,
    ''' Windows Graphics Capture, NvFBC).
    '''
    ''' ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    ''' PHASE 4 STABILIZATION — RELATIONSHIP WITH FOUNDATION
    ''' ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    '''
    ''' Decision: KEEP (with explicit ADAPTER boundary)
    '''
    ''' Foundation (CaptureEngine.Video, frozen @ 82d792ab):
    '''   - IVideoCaptureBackend (push model: Start(sink), no GetFrame)
    '''   - IVideoFrame (enum-based: VideoFrameOrigin, VideoPixelFormat)
    '''   - Sink-owned queue (BoundedVideoFrameSink)
    '''
    ''' New (CaptureEngine.Backends):
    '''   - IVideoBackend (pull model: Start(), GetFrame() → VideoFrame)
    '''   - VideoFrame (string-based: Origin, PixelFormat)
    '''   - Caller-owned polling (no internal queue)
    '''
    ''' Why both?
    '''   - Foundation is FROZEN — cannot modify it
    '''   - Foundation is push-based (sink queue, suitable for high-throughput
    '''     GPU pipeline). Pull-based model is needed for simpler FFmpeg-wrapping
    '''     backends where the caller polls Process output.
    '''   - OWNER explicitly requested IVideoBackend in Phase 5 of original
    '''     mission ("ต้อง compatible กับ CaptureEngine.Video")
    '''
    ''' Adapter boundary (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED — separate future task):
    '''   A `FoundationToIVideoBackendAdapter` class will:
    '''     1. Wrap an IVideoCaptureBackend instance
    '''     2. Internally create a sink queue (BoundedVideoFrameSink)
    '''     3. Implement IVideoBackend.Start() → call wrappedBackend.Start(sink)
    '''     4. Implement IVideoBackend.GetFrame() → take from sink (block with
    '''        bounded timeout, return Nothing on timeout)
    '''     5. Convert enum VideoFrameOrigin/PixelFormat to string properties
    '''     6. Implement IVideoBackend.Stop() → wrappedBackend.Stop()
    '''     7. Implement IVideoBackend.Dispose() → wrappedBackend.Dispose()
    '''
    '''   A regression test MUST be added when the adapter is implemented:
    '''     - Adapter Start → push N frames via fake → caller GetFrame N times
    '''       must return the same N frames in order
    '''     - Adapter Dispose-while-Running must route through Stop (Foundation
    '''       contract P1-B.1 FIX change #1)
    '''
    ''' Until adapter is implemented:
    '''   - IVideoBackend is an empty contract (no concrete implementations)
    '''   - Production Engine/ path does NOT use IVideoBackend (uses legacy
    '''     CaptureEngine.BuildFFmpegArguments directly)
    '''   - This is acceptable: V2 stays opt-in, production stays on V1
    '''
    ''' ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    '''
    ''' Lifecycle:
    '''   Create → Start → [GetFrame() repeatedly] → Stop → Dispose
    '''
    '''   Start is idempotent — calling it twice must not throw.
    '''   Stop is idempotent — calling it twice must not throw.
    '''   GetFrame is only valid between Start and Stop.
    '''   Dispose is idempotent — calling it twice must not throw.
    '''
    ''' Threading:
    '''   - Start, Stop, Dispose are thread-safe (may be called from any thread).
    '''   - GetFrame is intended to be called from a dedicated capture thread
    '''     (not the UI thread). It may block briefly waiting for the next
    '''     frame from the source.

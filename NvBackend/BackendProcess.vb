' Spawns and owns the node backend process. A Windows job object with
' KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE is the no-orphan guarantee: if the host dies for any
' reason (crash, hard kill, console close), the kernel closes the job and
' the backend cannot outlive its host. The backend is crash-safe by design
' (Backend\index.js: uncaughtException -> keep serving; store writes are
' atomic tmp+rename), so a kernel-level terminate on our death is safe.

' Concrete IVideoFrame implementation wrapping a D3D11 staging texture
' captured by DdagrabBackend via DXGI Output Duplication.
'
' Implements BOTH:
'   - CaptureEngine.Video.IVideoFrame (Foundation contract)
'   - CaptureEngine.Video.ID3D11VideoFrame (Phase 12 extension — exposes
'     NativeTexture pointer for zero-copy GPU encoding)
'
' OWNERSHIP MODEL (verified via handoff contract audit):
'   - D3D11VideoFrame OWNS the staging texture (created fresh per frame).
'   - When TryPush returns Pushed/Replaced: ownership TRANSFERS to sink.
'     Sink disposes the frame (and staging texture) when:
'       - consumer calls Take() and disposes the frame, OR
'       - frame is evicted from the bounded queue (DropOldest), OR
'       - sink.Dispose() runs (drains all queued frames).
'   - When TryPush returns Dropped: backend retains ownership and MUST
'     dispose the frame immediately.
'
' TEXTURE LIFETIME:
'   - The DXGI desktop texture is NOT owned by this frame (it belongs to
'     IDXGIOutputDuplication and is released via ReleaseFrame immediately
'     after CopyResource in DdagrabBackend.WorkerLoop).
'   - The staging texture is owned by this frame — created via
'     device.CreateTexture2D in DdagrabBackend.WorkerLoop, copied from
'     the DXGI desktop texture, then wrapped in D3D11VideoFrame.
'   - Dispose() releases the staging texture via Vortice.
'
' ALLOCATION STRATEGY:
'   - One staging texture per frame. This is a GPU allocation per frame —
'     not ideal for high-FPS capture (could pool staging textures).
'   - Phase 12a uses simple per-frame allocation. If profiling shows this
'     is a bottleneck, Phase 14+ can introduce a staging texture pool
'     (with borrow/return semantics). The interface does not change.
'
' THREAD SAFETY:
'   - Dispose uses Interlocked.CompareExchange — only one caller proceeds.
'   - All property reads return cached values (safe to call after Dispose).
'   - NativeTexture returns IntPtr.Zero after Dispose (defensive).

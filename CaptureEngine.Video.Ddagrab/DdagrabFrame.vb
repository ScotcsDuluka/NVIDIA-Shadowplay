    ''' <summary>
    ''' DdagrabFrame — placeholder IVideoFrame implementation for the
    ''' DdagrabBackend. (P1-A v1.3.1 §3, §11)
    '''
    ''' GLM-1 SKELETON STATUS:
    ''' This class exists so that when real DXGI Output Duplication is
    ''' implemented, the worker loop can construct DdagrabFrame instances
    ''' wrapping the captured ID3D11Texture2D and push them to the sink
    ''' via FrameAcquisitionResult.Available(...).
    '''
    ''' Currently NOT emitted by the skeleton worker (which emits NoFrame
    ''' forever). The class is included here so:
    '''   - The future real-implementation TODO has a concrete target type.
    '''   - Tests can construct DdagrabFrame instances directly to verify
    '''     the IVideoFrame contract surface (origin / pixel format /
    '''     dimensions / diagnostics / IDisposable).
    '''
    ''' Constraints honored:
    '''   - Implements the same IVideoFrame contract as FakeVideoFrame.
    '''   - Tracks DisposeCount for ownership/lifetime tests.
    '''   - No GPU resources held (placeholder).

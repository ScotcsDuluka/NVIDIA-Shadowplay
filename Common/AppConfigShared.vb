' AppConfigShared.vb — SHARED config.json ACCESS FOR NON-OVERLAY PROCESSES
'
' config.json (Config\config.json) is THE single user-facing settings file.
' The full typed model lives in the Overlay project (AppSettings), but three
' other processes need to touch individual keys without owning the schema:
'
'   NVIDIA Experience (Launcher)  — writes Overlay.UseOverlayEnabled (toggle)
'   NVIDIA API (hub)              — reads  Overlay.UseOverlayEnabled every
'                                   second to start/keep-alive or kill the
'                                   overlay stack (Notifier/ShadowPlay/Capture)
'   NVIDIA Notifier               — reads  UI.Language for localized toasts
'
' This module gives them a tiny, dependency-free read/patch API. It NEVER
' rewrites the file from a cached model: every write is a parse of the
' CURRENT file content, a one-key mutation, and an immediate write-back, so
' sections owned by other processes survive untouched.
'
'   ReadBool / ReadString  — missing file / corrupt JSON / wrong type →
'                            the caller's fallback. Never creates the file.
'   WriteBool              — creates the file (and section) on demand via
'                            AppLayout.EnsureParentDir; never throws.
'
' This file is deliberately dependency-free (besides AppLayout) and
' Option Strict On-clean so it compiles identically inside every app
' project — same contract as AppLayout.vb.

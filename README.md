# NVIDIA ShadowPlay

> [!NOTE]
> A custom screen capture utility inspired by NVIDIA ShadowPlay, built primarily in **<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/explore/refs/heads/main/topics/visual-basic/visual-basic.png" alt="Visual Basic Logo" width="15"> VB.NET** with a **no-hook** capture design.<br>
> Recording and encoding are powered by **FFmpeg**, with modular capture and encoder components under active development.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is still under active development. Some applications and protected/DRM content may not be capturable, depending on the capture path and operating-system restrictions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Runtime Dependency:** The current desktop application targets **.NET 10** and requires the **.NET 10 Desktop Runtime** when deployed as framework-dependent.<br><br>
> **OS Requirement:** Windows is required. Supported operating-system versions depend on the .NET 10 and Windows API requirements of the selected build. See the official .NET Windows support matrix for the current platform details.

## Features Overview

# Capture Your Best Moments

Professional-grade features inspired by NVIDIA ShadowPlay.

### Real-time Screen Recording

Record your gameplay or desktop in real time.
High-quality output with minimal performance impact, fully powered by NVIDIA NVENC hardware acceleration.

- Hardware-accelerated encoding
- Low CPU Usage
- Supports multiple formats

### Instant Replay

Automatically capture and save the last minutes of your gameplay with a single click. **Buffer engine is under active development** — not yet in the current build.

### Screensho

Snap crisp, high-resolution screenshots instantly. **Under active development** — not yet in the current build.

### No-Hook Architecture

Safe and secure by design. No memory injection, no hooks — just pure stability.

### NVIDIA Hardware Acceleration

Fully optimized with NVIDIA NVENC via FFmpeg. Fast, efficient, and reliable GPU-based encoding.
---

## Encoder & Capture

Modern capture APIs + hardware encoder status.

### Engine Regimes

| Engine Regime | Status | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **FFmpeg Capture** | Flexible | FFmpeg subprocess engine with multiple capture and encoder paths |
| **Duluka Capture** | **Production** | Native D3D11 + NVENC pipeline — the production engine behind the overlay |
| **OBS Capture** | **SOON** | Bridge / event forwarding |

### NVIDIA NVENC

**Ready**

Native in-app GPU encoding (production path): H.264 CBR/CFR, D3D11 texture submission, and explicit keyframe handling.

### Encoder Status

- [x] NVIDIA / NVENC ready
- [ ] Intel / Quick Sync
- [ ] AMD / AMF

### Intel QSV

**Not in this regime**

The native engine binds NVENC directly — QSV lives in the FFmpeg engine regime.

### AMD AMF

**Soon**

AMD Advanced Media Framework encoder on roadmap.

---

## API Capture

### DXGI Desktop Duplication

**Active**

The production capture path — D3D11 GPU frames with driver QPC presentation timestamps.

### Windows.Graphics.Capture

**Coming**

Slot prepared in the modular engine (`VideoBackendKind.GfxCapture`) — not the active production backend.

### Window / Region / Game

**Coming**

`d3d11_native`, `window_capture`, `region_capture` and `native_game_capture` remain on the roadmap.

Additionally supported capture options and planned backends:

- Windows.Graphics.Capture
- Desktop Duplication API
- GDI screen grabber

---

# Requirements

## System Requirements

### Operating System

**Windows 10 (19045+) / Windows 11**
64-bit — the application targets .NET 10. Older Windows versions including Windows 8/7/Vista/XP are not supported.

### .NET Desktop Runtime 10

The app targets .NET 10. Install the **.NET Desktop Runtime 10 (x64)** when it is not already included with the selected release package.

[**Download Runtime Package**](https://github.com/ScotcsDuluka/NVIDIA-Shadowplay/releases/download/REQUIRED/64bit.runtime.exe)

### Hardware

The native production engine requires an NVIDIA GPU with a supported NVENC encoder. The FFmpeg regime provides broader capture/encoder options where supported.
---

## Known Limitations

- **DRM Content:** Netflix/Disney+ blocked by Windows protection.
- **Fullscreen:** Exclusive mode not supported by the no-hook design.
- **Solution:** Use Borderless Windowed mode in games.

### Performance Optimization

For best results, use **NVIDIA hardware encoders** such as `h264_nvenc` through the FFmpeg path at **1920 × 1080 resolution** when appropriate for your hardware.

---

# Architecture

## Modular Architecture

Each module represents a distinct part of the current stack.

### CaptureEngine/

Core contracts and configuration: `IVideoBackend` / `IEncoderBackend` seams, configuration pipeline, and engine diagnostics. Producers plug into explicit backend contracts.

### Capture — Ddagrab/

Production capture: DXGI Desktop Duplication on D3D11, GPU-backed frames, and driver presentation timestamps in the QPC time domain.

### Encoder — NVENC/

Native in-app NVENC encoder: direct function-table binding rather than an FFmpeg encoder wrapper, with CBR/CFR configuration, first-frame keyframe handling, and D3D11 texture submission.

### Audio — WASAPI/

Shared audio path for system audio and microphone, aligned to the common QPC time domain with explicit queue and drop accounting.

### Live Mux — FFmpeg/

Named-pipe live muxer: H.264 + PCM stream into FFmpeg, fragmented MP4 during recording, faststart finalization, and controlled draining at stop.

### Overlay/

In-game borderless overlay with recording controls, keyboard shortcuts, settings, account UI, and gallery integration. The overlay does not own the native engine's GPU resources.

### Hub — NVIDIA API/

Local application hub coordinating the desktop application family and carrying engine command messages between components.
### Two Engine Regimes

The project intentionally keeps two distinct engine regimes:

```tex
Duluka Native Engine
    D3D11 Desktop Duplication
        ↓
    Native NVENC H.264
        ↓
    Audio / LiveMux orchestration

FFmpeg Engine Regime
    FFmpeg-managed capture backends
        ↓
    FFmpeg encoders / filters
        ↓
    Wider hardware support, including Intel QSV paths
```

The native Duluka engine is the production path. The FFmpeg regime provides broader capture and encoder combinations where the corresponding FFmpeg components are available and validated.

### Hub — NVIDIA API

TCP/local hub used to coordinate the desktop application family and carry engine commands between components.

## Development

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **`Stable`** | Default branch — last known-good build |
| **`Engine-Rebuild-Stabilization`** | Active development — modular capture engine, lifecycle hardening, sync/audio stabilization, and account integration |

The project is being developed as a modular capture stack rather than a direct copy of NVIDIA's internal implementation.

Engine documentation lives in [`docs/`](docs/), starting with [`docs/PHASE_PLAN.md`](docs/PHASE_PLAN.md). The module map is documented in [`PROJECT-STRUCTURE.md`](PROJECT-STRUCTURE.md), with build and diagnostic entry points under [`scripts/`](scripts/).

### Current Engineering Focus
- Capture backend lifecycle and ownership
- Video frame delivery and timestamp correctness
- NVENC configuration authority and synchronization
- FFmpeg recording/mux integration
- Duluka Account authentication and identity semantics
- Regression and integration testing

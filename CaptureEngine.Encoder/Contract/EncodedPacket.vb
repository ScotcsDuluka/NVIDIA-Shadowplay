    ''' <summary>
    ''' A single encoded video packet (one access unit / one AVPacket equivalent).
    ''' (P1-F §5.1)
    '''
    ''' OWNERSHIP MODEL (critical — read before modifying):
    '''
    '''   1. EncodedPacket is owned by EXACTLY ONE caller at a time.
    '''   2. The caller receives ownership from IEncoderBackend.Encode() return value
    '''      OR from Flush(sink) callback.
    '''   3. The owner MUST call Dispose() when done — this releases the
    '''      underlying byte[] buffer back to the encoder's pool (future)
    '''      OR leaves it for GC (current default).
    '''   4. After Dispose(), accessing Payload OR Metadata is UNDEFINED
    '''      BEHAVIOR — implementations MUST treat the packet as invalid.
    '''   5. Dispose() is IDEMPOTENT — calling it more than once is safe
    '''      (per P1-B.1 FIX lesson #3: never throw from Dispose).
    '''   6. Dispose() is THREAD-SAFE — uses Interlocked.Increment to
    '''      atomically update _disposeCount (fixes non-atomic read-modify-write
    '''      race that was present in v1.0).
    '''
    ''' DATA OWNERSHIP:
    '''   - Payload (byte[]): owned by this packet. The byte[] is allocated
    '''     by the encoder; the packet is the sole owner. Disposing the
    '''     packet releases the reference; GC reclaims the array.
    '''   - In a future pooled-buffer variant, Dispose() would return the
    '''     byte[] to the pool. This contract accommodates that — callers
    '''     MUST NOT retain references to Payload beyond Dispose().
    '''
    ''' THREADING:
    '''   - Encode() is called from the encoder's worker thread (or caller thread
    '''     for synchronous encoders).
    '''   - Dispose() may be called from a different thread (e.g. the muxer thread).
    '''   - Interlocked.Increment ensures the _disposeCount update is atomic
    '''     across threads, fixing the race condition present in v1.0
    '''     (which used non-atomic VolatileRead+VolatileWrite).
